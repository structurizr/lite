# Structurizr Lite

This free and open source version of Structurizr allows you to view/edit diagrams, view documentation,
and view architecture decision records defined via a DSL or JSON workspace. Structurizr Lite can be
used standalone for workspace viewing/authoring, or in conjunction with the cloud service/on-premises
installation as an authoring/testing/staging environment.

See [https://docs.structurizr.com/lite](https://docs.structurizr.com/lite) for documentation.
